                            <li>There is no efficient or effective way for both clients and agent to collaborate with one another. The current state of the platform promotes individual products and features, creating inset functionality which ultimately causes confusion and frustration for both clients and agents. As a result, the agent must spend more time and investment to bring the potential client up to speed on how to properly use and understand Compass's platforms. (See image directly below) </li>

            <h6 class="ps-1"> A bit of background </h6>
            <p>The client dashboard, aka Home, was broken up into a three-phase approach that spans the needs of other development teams and stakeholders across Compass. The case study below is presented from the lens of the team I supported, the buy-side team, and the output created for phase 1 of the client dashboard.  The buy-side team is the first and only team to deploy for phase 1 due to the business needs, market demand, and scope of work negotiated. Our team is creating the foundation to which other teams will leverage in future iterations of the client dashboard. </p>

            <p>Currently on Compass, there are several types of products that both a client and agent can create. "Collections" is to name one, and "Saved Search" is to name the other. Both have their own capabilities and are independent of one another. However, depending on who creates the collection or saved search will also determine the set of capabilities associated with it. This model does not allow for seamless collaboration between agent, client, and technology. </p>

            <p>For example, a collection created by an agent and shared with a client will show all collaborative actions like marking a listing as a favorite or not interested, commenting on a listing, sharing a listing, and requesting a tour. If a client were to engage with one of those actions the agent would be notified. </p>

            <p>However, if a client creates a saved search or a collection. There is only a single action that can be taken, favorite a listing. Moreover, that engagement is not shared with your agent due to a lack of visibility on client created materials. The confusion between the experiences have been documented by the research department at Compass and this is just one example of the gaps the buy-side team is solving for with the client dashboard. </p>

        <h3 class="ps-1"> PROCESS</h3>
        <p class="text-dark"> After the initial kick-off meeting, the first design artifact produced was a competitive analysis. Or what Compass likes to call, LFR. Learn. From. Reality. The research provided a landscape for buy-side team members to better understand how direct and indirect competitors executed similar experiences. The full list is seen here: Redfin, Zillow, Realator.com, StreetEasy, Opendoor, Homesnap, Trullia, Real scout, Home Depot, Disney &amp; Airbnb</p>

          </div>
        </div>


       
        <p class="text-dark"> When the competitive research was complete, the buy-side team held a half-day design session. The goal of the design session was to breakdown how direct and indirect competitors were creating these experiences and how might Compass build similar products that were elevated. Two products Compass was looking to push forward and learn from a design and research perspective was the Client Dashboard and Listing Feed. One of the goals from the design session was to have a clear perspective of how these two products would function with one another and how might they be integrated into our existing platforms that would make sense from a client and agent viewpoint. </p>

        <h3 class="ps-1"> USER TESTING FINDINGS</h3>
        <p class="text-dark"> Jared, from our research team, conducted a moderated, mobile app test, with 8 participants on usertesting.com. At this point in time, the client dashboard and listing feed were both a bottom navigational item. They were thought of as separate products. The first round of testing takeaways can be seen below. 
        </p>


        <div class="col-md-12 line-height-28 last-paragraph-no-margin wow fadeInUp" style="visibility: visible;animation-name: fadeInUp;">
            <ul class="list-style-6">
                <li class="text-extra-small text-uppercase text-dark-gray font-weight-500 line-height-22">RESEARCH TAKEAWAYS</li>
                <li>The proposed Compass app experience for buyers is headed in the right direction. Participants rated the experience depicted in the prototype as comparable or superior to that of competitors’ apps. <br>Client Home was understood as a “summary” of the buyer’s home search. Participants gave neutral to positive feedback about it: It straightforwardly did what they believed it should do. <br> Listings Feed was not as clearly understood. It wasn’t clear to participants that it surfaced updates to listings, rather than being a destination for all listings or saved listings. It wasn’t perceived as clearly differentiated from Client Home, or even from Notifications (unexplored in the present study).<br>Triaging options surfaced at the listing-card level sufficed, although an additional “maybe” bucket was believed by some to potentially help in the listing-narrowing process. Relatedly, some participants described a 2-step listing-review process that involved an initial round of separating “not interested” from possible contenders and a follow-up round of separating top-tier and second-tier listings. In that framing, an additional “maybe” option at the listing-card level would not be necessary. <br> In-app communication again emerged as particularly valuable and differentiating. </li>

You can reference the images below of what I created for the buy-side client dashboard journey.
