                            <li>There is currently no efficient or effective way for clients and agents to collaborate. The platform's current structure emphasizes individual products and features, leading to fragmented functionality that often results in confusion and frustration for both parties. As a consequence, agents are required to invest additional time and effort to help potential clients understand and navigate Compass’s platforms effectively. (See image directly below) </li>

            <h6 class="ps-1"> SETTING THE FOUNDATION </h6>
            <p>The Client Home, referred to internally as "Home," was developed as part of a three-phase initiative aimed at addressing the needs of multiple development teams and stakeholders across Compass. This case study focuses on the work completed by the buy-side team and outlines the key deliverables from Phase 1. Based on business priorities, market demand, and the agreed-upon scope of work, the buy-side team was the first and only team to deploy during this initial phase. The work completed here establishes a foundation that other teams will build upon in future phases of the Client Home.</p>

            <h6 class="ps-1"> FRAGMENTED EXPERIENCES ACROSS PRODUCTS</h6>

            <p>Currently within Compass, there are multiple tools that both clients and agents can create and use. Two of the most prominent are "Collections" and "Saved Searches." While both serve important purposes, they operate independently and offer different capabilities depending on who initiates them—client or agent. This separation introduces confusion and inconsistency in the collaborative experience.</p>

            <P>For instance, when an agent creates a collection and shares it with a client, the client gains access to a full set of collaborative features. These include favoriting or marking listings as not interested, commenting, sharing listings, and requesting tours. Agents are notified whenever clients interact with these features, allowing for active and informed engagement.</P>

            <p>However, when a client creates a collection or saved search, the functionality is much more limited. The only available action is favoriting a listing, and this activity is not visible to the agent. The lack of shared visibility creates a disconnect, hindering collaboration and diminishing the overall experience for both the client and the agent.</p>

            <h6 class="ps-1"> ADDRESSING COLLABORATION GAPS</h6>
            <P>These usability gaps have been documented by Compass’s research team and reflect larger issues in how clients, agents, and the platform interact. Solving these challenges is a core focus of the Client Home initiative. Phase 1, led by the buy-side team, is specifically designed to close these gaps by establishing a unified, collaborative foundation. This groundwork will support future enhancements and ensure a more cohesive and user-friendly experience across the Compass platform.</P>

                <li>The proposed Compass app experience for buyers is headed in the right direction. Participants rated the experience depicted in the prototype as comparable or superior to that of competitors’ apps. <br>Client Home was understood as a “summary” of the buyer’s home search. Participants gave neutral to positive feedback about it: It straightforwardly did what they believed it should do. <br> Listings Feed was not as clearly understood. It wasn’t clear to participants that it surfaced updates to listings, rather than being a destination for all listings or saved listings. It wasn’t perceived as clearly differentiated from Client Home, or even from Notifications (unexplored in the present study).<br>Triaging options surfaced at the listing-card level sufficed, although an additional “maybe” bucket was believed by some to potentially help in the listing-narrowing process. Relatedly, some participants described a 2-step listing-review process that involved an initial round of separating “not interested” from possible contenders and a follow-up round of separating top-tier and second-tier listings. In that framing, an additional “maybe” option at the listing-card level would not be necessary. <br> In-app communication again emerged as particularly valuable and differentiating. </li>

        <h3 class="ps-1"> DESIGN ITERATIONS & STRATEGY</h3>
        <p class="text-dark"> After the first round of testing was complete, the buy-side team knew that client home and feed as separate products and work streams on the navbar would not be optimal for our client base.</p>
        <p>As I get further into the buy-side client home and feed concepts, I begin to familiarize myself with other teams and stakeholder needs. The cross-functional team collaboration helped to highlight questions and shortcomings of what Client Home could be. </p>
        <p>The images below illustrates some of the strategic design conversations that the buy-side identified that need understanding from cross-functional teams on how they will execute their products into the client home. Some of the concerns are: how will client home scale in the current IA and with other teams products and services coming post M0 launch, the current IA is lacking alignment based on user feedback and needs realignment across the organization, scenarios regarding multiple transactions; what does an agent get to see and how that might affect data and multiple transactions.  </p>

        <h5 class="ps-1"> IA STRATEGY</h5>
        <p>The IA on the app needs to alignment with all cross-functional stakeholders. The current agreement for M0 deployment, the internal name for the first client home mvp, is the buy-side team will take over the current “Home” nav item for the new client home. All other nav items will stay the same. Duplication of content in the “Saved” nav item become useless and potentially a pain point for users. </p>

                <li>The new proposed combined Client Home & feed experience was better received than last round of testing. <br>Client Home was understood as a “dashboard” of the buyer’s home search. <br>Limiting certain triaging options at the listing-card level sufficed due to needing more information to make a decision. <br> In-app communication again emerged as particularly valuable and differentiating.<br> The 2-step listing review process can up again. Users found it to be easier to manage triaged homes on the new Client Home  <br>The majority of test subjects pointed out the agent branding and was well received. It brings in a more personalized experience where my agent is always there to help when I need him/her. </li>

          <p class="text-dark"> I brought up a concern in Compass’s current agent onboarding process that would promote a dark pattern if no solution was in place for Milestone 0. In the current process, an agent sends out an email for the potential client to accept so they can begin working together in a single collaborative space. The concern comes into play when a client is already in the app prior to their relationship or bypasses the email and downloads the app with the email address tied to the agent invite email.  The current system does not take these scenarios into account nor when a client has a previous purchase through Compass or multiple active client/agent relationships. </p>
          <p class="text-dark">My goal for our current and future clients is to be upfront and honest, while not making assumptions about their needs. Just because an email went out from an agent shouldn’t mean we auto-accept them into the Client Home space. </p>
          <p class="text-dark">The flow diagram presents the scenarios mentions above and depicts how and when a client enters a collaborative client/agent home search process. </p>

        <p class="text-dark"> The goal of creating a space where clients and agents can easily collaborate, stay aligned, and find their dream home is one step closer with the Client Home phase one implementation. You can reference the images below of what I created for the buy-side Client Home journey.
        </p>
        <p> Another project that I worked on and is directly tied to the Client Home is the Listing Feed. Please go to this project and see the iteration of the buy-side improvements for the Client Home phase three.</p>
